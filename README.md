# MyNodejsWebSite
Web app with Node.js

Here I made a simple Web App withNode.js.
The packages I used are Express and MySQL.
The Web App is going to be updated with time to add more stuff.
##SQL Script
I have placed a small MySQL script to be executed so the app can show off all its functions. So you are required to have a MySQL server. The SQL database is going to get bigger with time, but for now there is only one table named Animals. I am using the root user just for demonstration, but it is good practice to create a new user and give him only the privileges he needs for security.Â
